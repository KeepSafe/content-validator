##PIN timeout
Do you go in and out of KeepSafe frequently? [Premium makes this safer and faster](http://support.getkeepsafe.com/hc/articles/204056310).

Activate PIN timeout and KeepSafe stays unlocked for 30 seconds after you leave the app. If you come back within that time, you wonâ€™t have to enter your PIN.
